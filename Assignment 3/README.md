      Throughout the term you will complete a project in small groups. Your
group must be made up of students in the same lab section. In this
project, you will design, implement, and evaluate a prototype user
interface. The project will be broken down into several assignments. Some
assignments will be completed individually (I) and others with your project
group (G). A tentative schedule is given below.
<br/>
<br/>
For any group submission, if the student has not contributed to the individual component of that assignment they will receive a zero grade on the assignment.

      Participation  
    </td>
    <td width="80%" class="course_desc_detail">
      In this course there will be a number of in class and online activities, based on the lecture material. Most of the exercises will be done in groups and will add up to a total of 10% of the overall grade. Each student can expect to do at least ten of these exercises over the course of the term.
<br/>
<br/>
Dates for the exercises will not be announced in advance: students are expected to attend all lectures and labs, therefore no make up exercises will be given. Students that miss one of these exercises because of illness or grave family circumstances should see the professor in person with supporting documentation (e.g. a doctor's note) within 7 days of the date on the documentation. If a face to face meeting within 7 days is not possible, contact the professor via email within the 7 day time span to set up a future in-person meeting.

      There will be a midterm and a final exam.
The midterm exam, worth <b>20%</b> is tentatively on <b>June 15</b>.
The final exam, worth <b>35%</b> will be scheduled by the University. In order to pass the course, you must obtain a passing grade on the final exam.
<br/>
<br/>
For courses which have final exams, students are strongly advised not to
make final plans for travel or employment during the exam period since
special arrangements will not be made for examinations that may conflict
with such plans.

      Grading Scheme

    <td width="80%" class="course_desc_detail">
      Effective Summer 2014, University of Victoria follows a "percentage grading system" in which the instructor will submit grades in percentages. The University will use the following Senate approved standardized grading scale to assign letter grades.  Both the percentage mark and the letter grade will be recorded on the academic record and transcripts.

      Course Evaluation Survey (CES) is an important activity through which the instructor and the department can get valuable feedback about the course from the students directly. Towards the end of term, as in all other courses at UVic, students will have the opportunity to complete an anonymous survey regarding course learning experience. This survey is vital to providing feedback regarding the course, the instructor and the teaching, as well as to help the department improve the overall program for students in the future. The survey is accessed via MyPage and can be completed using a laptop, tablet, or any mobile device. The instructor will remind students and provide with more detailed information near the end of term but please be thinking about this important activity during the course.

      Course Policies And Guidelines  
    </td>
    <td width="80%" class="course_desc_detail">

<br/>
<b><i>Midterm:</b></i>  Concession for missed midterm will only be granted in extenuating circumstances (e.g. illness) and notification of the absence must be sent to the instructor before the midterm.
<br/>
<b><i>Group participation:</b></i> Some assignments have both individual and group components.  If the individual component of a given assignment is not completed, you will be given 0 on the group component of that assignment as well.
<br/>
<b><i>Coursework Mark Appeals:</b></i> All marks must be appealed <b>within 7 days</b> of the mark being posted.
<br/>
<b><i>Attendance:</b></i> We expect students to attend all lectures and labs. It is entirely the students' responsibility to recover any information or announcements presented in lectures from which they were absent.
<br/>
<b><i>Electronic devices in labs and lectures:</b></i> No unauthorized <i>audio</i> or <i>video</i> recording of lectures is permitted.
<br/>
<b><i>Electronic devices in midterms and exams: </b></i> No electronic devices (e.g. cell phones, pagers, PDA, etc.) may be used during examinations or tests <i>unless explicitly authorized</i>.
<br/>
<b><i>Plagiarism:</b></i> Submitted work may be checked using plagiarism detection software. Cheating, plagiarism and other forms of academic fraud are taken very seriously by both the University and the Department. You should consult <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/calendar/FACS/UnIn/UARe/PoAcI.html">http://web.uvic.ca/calendar/FACS/UnIn/UARe/PoAcI.html</a>
for the UVic policy on academic integrity. Note that the university policy includes the statement that "A largely or fully plagiarized assignment should result in a grade of F for the course".

      <p>This course aims to provide equal opportunities and access for all students to enjoy the benefits and privileges of the class and its curriculum and to meet the syllabus requirements.  Reasonable and appropriate accommodation will be made available to students with documented disabilities (physical, mental, learning) in order to give them the opportunity to successfully meet the essential requirements of the course. The accommodation will not alter academic standards or learning outcomes, although the student may be allowed to demonstrate knowledge and skills in a different way.  It is not necessary for you to reveal your disability and/or confidential medical information to the course instructor.  If you believe that you may require accommodation, the course instructor can provide you with information about confidential resources on campus that can assist you in arranging for appropriate accommodation.  Alternatively, you may want to contact the Resource Centre for Students with a Disability located in the Campus Services Building.
