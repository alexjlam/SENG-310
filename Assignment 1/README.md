###### Additional instructor's comments about your submission
Furious 4
 
Description:- 
Very precise and neat description. The Idea looks great and can turn into a real application that can be useful for many people. As many people are too lazy to check the accounts on the daily basis and plan things.
 
Users:-
Target Audience is essentially freshman and young people.
 
 
Interview Questions:-
Good selection of questions especially the parts mentioned in the parenthesis. That part can be used to make questions clear by the interviewer.
 
General Comment:-
The Banks these days have those apps that divide your spending in different category (example: - grocery, school etc.) How is this app going to be different from those already in market?)
 
Do you think synchronising the app with your bank account is possible(security threats)? 
 
It's better to increase the age group because the finance management is not the problem with just students but most of the people.
 
Do some research which graphs can be used to represents the data in a well-mannered way (specifically how people understand graphs HCI component).
 
How about adding notifications about expenditure every day?
 
Scenario: - You have already spent $400 on clothing, and you are still eyeing on new items. Can you use your app to see whether that item fits your budget?
