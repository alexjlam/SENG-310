App Description: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good Money is a financial assistant app designed to help people (specifically
 students and young adults) manage their spending responsibly by keeping
 track of their monthly income and expenses.
 This app is able to link up to a personal bank account and sync credit/debit
 cards to automatically update the app.
 As the user makes purchases, the application will graph out the expenses,
 income, and net balance over time and categorize what type of purchases
 were made (eg.
 eating out, entertainment, groceries).
 This will show the user how their money is being spent on what items throughout
 the month.
 Some other features could also include having the app analyze the user’s
 expenses and make recommendations based off spending habits and setting
 monthly goals and keeping track of progress of how much to spend/day to
 reach a goal.
